  abstract = {Recently there has been a remarkable synergy between the technologies
	of precision laser stabilization and mode-locked ultrafast lasers.
	This has resulted in control of the frequency spectrum produced by
	mode-locked lasers, which consists of a regular comb of sharp lines.
	Thus such a controlled mode-locked laser is a ``femtosecond optical
	frequency comb generator.'' For a sufficiently broad comb, it is
	possible to determine the absolute frequencies of all of the comb
	lines. This ability has revolutionized optical frequency metrology
	and synthesis. It has also served as the basis for the recent demonstrations
	of atomic clocks that utilize an optical frequency transition. In
	addition, it is having an impact on time-domain applications, including
	synthesis of a single pulse from two independent lasers. In this
	Colloquium, we first review the frequency-domain description of a
	mode-locked laser and the connection between the pulse phase and
	the frequency spectrum in order to provide a basis for understanding
	how the absolute frequencies can be determined and controlled. Using
	this understanding, applications in optical frequency metrology and
	synthesis and optical atomic clocks are discussed. This is followed
	by a brief overview of how the comb technology is affecting and will
	affect time-domain experiments.},
