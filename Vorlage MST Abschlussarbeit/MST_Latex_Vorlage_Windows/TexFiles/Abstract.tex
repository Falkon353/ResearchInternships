The CubeSat MOVE-II attitude determination system needed testing before it could be deployed on the satellite. Several methods of testing where discussed and two were chosen. A simple test called Algorithm only that only tested the algorithm and a test called Outdoor test that could test almost the entire system where chosen. The tests were able to give valuable information about the functionality of the system. They verified that the system work under best case condition and revealed some weaknesses like that it does not work with a stationary satellite whiteout sun and the system is vulnerable to noise on the sun sensor measurements.
